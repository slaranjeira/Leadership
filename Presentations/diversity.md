# How to diversify without negatively affecting the cohesion / harmony of the group?

## Before hiring

### Know your own team

What types of personalities do we have on our team?

What type of personality are we looking for our team? Or what type of personality do we *not* want on our team?

We should spend time to get to know each element:

- What type of work does this person developed in the past?
- In which topics does this person fell more and less confortable?
- What are his/her motivation?
- What valorizes?
- What type of personality does he/she have?
- What type of person would be a good fit to work with?

> Look for candidates with commom preferences or tastes. Something that relates to other team members, to ease the transition and integration on the team.

If there are no common points with the team, it could be a lot harder to integrate that person later.

> Build a team of different personalities

A lot of theories say that high-performing team have different types of roles inside the team and a collection of different personality types.

Examples:

- Lider
- Team player
- Expert
- Communicator

## Hiring Process

### Know your candidate

Think of what will this candidate affect the group dynamics

> Hire based on personality and not on technical expertise. Two methods we can follow here: valorize good behaviours or valorize the absence of bad behavirours.

Examples:

- Without excess of confidence
- Eager to learn
- Accept criticism
- Love what they do
- Can take the blame when something goes wrong
- Respect for the other

> Involve the team on the hiring process

- Work with the team for a while, and the team can say if it is a good fit or not
- Pair programming during interview phase

## After Hiring

How to improve integration on the team:

- Look for common goals and put 2 or 3 elements working on the same goal
- Team building
- Pair programming
- Rotate teams to know other realities/workflows/personalities and build connections

If nothing works:

- Change team
