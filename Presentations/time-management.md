## Prioritisation

The simple way to decide how to prioritize your tasks is to write them down and draw 3 columns next to them.

|                   | Urgent | Important | Score |
|-------------------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Save the world    |        |           |       |
| Wash cape         |        |           |       |
| Check fan mail    |        |           |       |
| Put the trash out |        |           |       |

> **Important**

> Its completion would significantly contribute to our key aims and objectives

> **Urgent**

> Requires our immediate attention

Then give a score to each task, from 1 (not very urgent/important) to 3 (very urgent/important). Now multiply `urgent` with `important` to get the score. Then order them to get your priority list.

|                     | Urgent   | Important   | Score   |
| ------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| Save the world      | 3        | 3           | 9       |
| Wash cape           | 1        | 2           | 2       |
| Check fan mail      | 3        | 1           | 3       |
| Put the trash out   | 1        | 3           | 3       |

### However...

Some say we shouldn't focus on getting more things done (being **efficient**), we should focus on getting more important things done (being **effective**).

Often we give to much attention to things that appear to be urgent (for example the phone rings or a window pops up in your computer). All of this place an immediate demand on our time, but they may not require attention right away. **They are urgent, but are they important?**

Instead of a simple scoring method, we could make a 2x2 matrix, showing all the combinations.

```
                Urgent                    Not urgent
              | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
              | Crisis                    | Maximising opportunities   |
Important     | Deadlines                 | Risk management            |
              | Crashed server            |                            |
              | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
              | Interruptions             | Trivia                     |
Not important | Most meetings and emails  | Magazines                  |
              | Phone calls               | Time wasters               |
              | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
```

#### Quadrant 1

Tasks that are both important and urgent, which typically means emergencies or problems. This is what appears to require immediate attention, and really do require.

#### Quadrant 2

Tasks important but not urgent. Completing this tasks would help make significant progress toward our goals, but they can wait until tomorrow (they're not urgent). Typically these taks are about planning ahead or building relationships with people.

#### Quadrant 3

Tasks urget, but not important. They are not important, but always manage to find us. Anything that tries to grab our attention. We feel the need to say "yes" to this tasks to appear productive, and we avoid to say "no" because it would seem uncooperative. 

#### Quadrant 4

Tasks neither urgent nor important.

### The key to effectiveness

Cutting back on the time we spent on quadrant 3 and spending that time on quadrant 2 activities.

So, rather than say "yes" to everything that comes along (quadrants 1 and 3), focus on the importance of what's being asked. Take just a second before choosing to start a task:

> Is this the most important thing I can be doing right now?
> Or is this just the next thing?

Spend a bit more time in quadrant 2 each day will have a significant impact on our lives. A bit more time thinking ahead and building relationships should help prevent crisis in quadrant 1, allowing more valuable time in quadrant 2.

## Procrastination

Act of putting off doing things that we should be doing right now, in favour of doing something more confortable.

Let's go over some steps to control and deal with it.

### 1. Recognise

If you're honest with yourself, you'll probably know when you're procrastinating. Here are some tips:

- Filling your time with low priority tasks
- Sitting down to start a high priority task and immediately deciding to do a trivial task (like a cup of coffee)
- Leaving an item on a To-Do list for a long time
- Saying "yes" to uninportant tasks instead of tackling the important ones
- Waiting for the "perfect time" before getting started

### 2. Understand why

The reasons depend on you and the task, but here are the most common causes:

- **Fear** of not doing well or not knowing how to do something
- **Perfection**. Finding a way to perfect something is a form of procrastination
- **Distractions** like email, social networks, tv, etc. These urges are hard to resist because they provide short-term reward and pleasure
- **Tiredness**. Sometimes we don't have the energy to attempt difficult tasks
- **Overwhelm**. Maybe it's too much going on in one task and you're not sure where to start

### 3. Anti-procrastination techniques

Procrastination is a habit, and we won't just break it overnight. It will take repeated practise and awareness to develop new habits to replace the old procrastination habits.

#### Create rewards

Promise yourself a treat for lunch if you complete an important task, enjoy a small victory!

#### Ask a friend to check up on you

Gives you accountability and can be an effective way to combat procrastination.

#### Create a penalty

Create an unpleasant consequency if you do not complete an important task, like having something aweful for lunch.

#### "Eat a frog" first thing every day

There is an old saying that says 

> If the first thing you do when you wake up every morning is eat a live frog, nothing worst can happen for the rest of the day.

In our case, our "frog" is our most difficult task in our To-Do list. If you "eat" that first in the morning, it'll give you energy and momentum for the rest of the day; if you let it sit there on a plate, while you do 100 unimportant things, you are wasting valuable time and energy, tricking yourself into thinking you are being productive.
